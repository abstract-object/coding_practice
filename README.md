# Coding practice

## 42/Codam C Piscine
These exercises are from a month-long evaluation period for [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/).
There is a coding style guide along with a linter that I could not run successfully. I have tried to follow what was clearly written. Each exercise also has a list of allowed functions, and many features, including for loops, are prohibited. I am somewhat confused by these restrictions as I did not see them in place for 42, whose curriculum was adapted for Codam. Nevertheless, I will attempt to follow them.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
I have been learning computer science fundamentals on my own, since August. Exercises will be put into the appropriate folder as I learn more.

## Python
I have started a few projects in Python, though I have not prioritized finishing them, as I had been concentrating more on other things. I am interested to continue learning Python, and will update these old projects eventually.

## Functional programming
I plan to learn more about functional programming, likely starting with Haskell.
